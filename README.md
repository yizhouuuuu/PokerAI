## The initial Poker AI project
* We started off trying to use someone else's game framework so that we could move straight to the AI, but there were a few inexplicable bugs that we couldn't solve, so we rebooted the project, and added an o to the name, and so Pooker was born!
* Take a look at http://github.com/OwenQian/Pooker for the up to date version
